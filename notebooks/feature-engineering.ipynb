    "Toward the end of my time with feature engineering, I discovered that not all the data elements I pulled from the data gathering time were going to be useful for the project. That said, I'm going to drop these columns right at the outset of feature engineering here. Here is a list of those data elements and why they are being dropped. The one exception we will make is `movie_name`.\n",

So for example, \"The Matrix\" is probably climbing in popularity right now as we get close to the release of the new Matrix movie, \"The Matrix Resurrections.\" That said, this feature isn't reliable for our model."

    "- `metascore`: This one was tricky. Whereas I was able to find a source above to point to the 59% number for RT critic scores, I could not find the equivalent for the metascore. Unfortunately, we're going to have to go middle of the road here at an even 50.\n",
    "- `rt_audience_score`: This was also a difficult one to deal with as I could not find a source that would give a definitive answer. From my time analyzing the data, I find that while the critics and audience can vary in their arguments, they both seem to have a bell curve of movies getting ratings right around that 59% mark. So to match the `rt_critic_score`, we're going to fill these nulls also with a value of 59."
