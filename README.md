# Movie Rating Model
This repository houses all the code created by David Hundley to create a model for predicting future movie ratings from movie reviewer extraordinaire and lover of all things sour, Caelan Biehn.



## Background
I (David Hundley) enjoy listening to a lot of podcasts, but none of them quite captured my consistent interest as that of a podcast called **The Watercooler**. Aptly referred to once by somebody who shall remain unnamed (only because I forgot who), The Watercooler is very much the Seinfeld of podcasts: it's a podcast about... nothing! It's a time when five guys get together to talk about how their weeks are going, food, movies, cultural phenomenons, and more. The Watercooler has recurring bits, and one of these bits is a time in which the aforementioned Caelan Biehn will rate anything and everything, from grass (8.9) to the word "facetious" (9.4) to his own daughter (9.0). That's right, folks, the word "facetious" edged out his own daughter on this illustrious Biehn scale.

But by far, Caelan will use this time to rate movies. From the latest hits debuting on HBO Max to something that's probably going to have subtitles because it's not in English, Caelan provides two scores to a movie: one binary "yes/no" and another single decimal float between 0 and 10, aka the **Biehn Scale**. The Biehn Scale is a highly attuned scientific device. Its precision is so finely tuned that things rated on the Biehn scale shall never be updated. Our finest scientists still struggle to understand how the Biehn scale works. In late 2019, there was an accident at a lab where Mr. Biehn rated the movie *Alita: Battle Angel* a score of 8.6, but shortly thereafter Mr. Biehn gave the experience of watching *Alita: Battle Angel* in theaters a perfect 10 score. One of our brightest mind's head exploded when trying to hold this paradox in their head.

All silliness aside, I thought it would be fun to build a predictive model around Caelan's scores that he gives to movies. It also gave me a great excuse to go back and listen to their back catalog of podcasts, as I have now been collecting [all of Caelan's ratings in a Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-8tdDUtm0iBrCdCRAsYCw2KOimecrHcmsnL-aqG-l0E/edit?usp=sharing). As of Sept. 2021, I still have a ways to go through the back catalog, but I think I have enough data now to build a twin set of predictive models to predict future movie scores from Caelan. This isn't meant to be a perfectly predictive set of models, but I thought it'd be fun!
